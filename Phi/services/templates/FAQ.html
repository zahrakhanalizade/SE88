        			That's an excellent question. Well, let's get a little bit into details here. A film, also called a movie or motion picture, is actually a series of still images which, when shown on a screen, creates the illusion of moving images due to the Phi phenomenon. The Phi phenomenon is the optical illusion of perceiving continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. The phenomenon was defined by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Wertheimer">Max Wertheimer</a> in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestalt_psychology">Gestalt psychology</a> in 1912 and along with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistence_of_vision">persistence of vision</a> formed a part of the base of the theory of cinema, applied by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_M%C3%BCnsterberg">Hugo M&uuml;nsterberg</a> in 1916. It is part of a larger process called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_perception">motion perception</a>.
        			<br />
        			So, as you've probably already guessed, we are called Phi because of this amazing phenomenon.
